This week we learned about if/else statements and switch/case, lots of JS
It has been very difficult, i feel like we are moving way too fast, and I retreat when i feel like i cant understand.
The best way is using the actual code and figuring it out, but if the subject is rushed over, i feel lost.
The real problem is the gap in knowledge in our class. we have people with a lot of coding experience, who know all of
this stuff, but this is for entry level learners, we can't just randomly code using code we dont know how to use
or what it is for.

That is the main challenge I faced this week, and every week. Most weeks i have been able to keep up through self study at home and trial
and error, but this week, starting with the if/else statements, i couldnt understand or follow the lesson at all, and i know
that many of my peers feel the same, and it starts to create a rift, we feel like we are not being taught properly, so how
are we to use these skills that we are really unsure of. And when this happens, we retreat, and wonder if this we are 
really good enough for this class, which we shouldnt be as it is our 4th week of the first year.
I believe it's because of all the experienced and smart coders in the class, they want everything to be rushed because they know it all already.
But the majority of the class are BEGINNERS who need a lot more help to understand the lesson taught.
Because this week, me and a few peers REALLY felt out of our league and felt like we had NO idea what we were doing.

I figured out the code in the end, but i couldnt of done so without looking it up on the internet and finding details of how if/else/switch/case works, In understandable english, not completely random jargon.
